# Wikipedia "Bacon" crawler

This does a breadth-first search through wikipedia links (outgoing links only) and finds the number of links between a start page and the wikipedia page of Kevin Bacon.

It's a node console program - all input/output is through the console.

To run, `npm install` and `npm start` from the root directory.
